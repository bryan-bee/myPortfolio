# Netlify Marketing Tokens [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@netlify/netlify-marketing-tokens.svg)](https://npmjs.com/@netlify/netlify-marketing-tokens)

Repo contains Netlify's design tokens that are affiliated with the Marketing team. 

## Install

Clone this repository, then run: 

```bash
npm install
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

We use [Figma Tokens](https://www.figmatokens.com/) to create our tokens. If you're looking to get setup with using Figma Tokens and the Marketing Tokens repo you can refer to [Getting started with Figma Tokens](https://www.notion.so/netlify/Getting-started-with-Figma-Tokens-6bc52c61861045bc9955e223d0d65f63). Figma Tokens has the capability of pushing it's token sheet as JSON that you can find in the [/tokens](/tokens) directory. 

Using [token-transformer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/token-transformer) we are able to turn Figma Tokens JSON into something that Style Dictionary can parse and turn into CSS. 

Our [build.js](/build.js) file uses Style Dictionary to transforms our token-transformer output into valid CSS variables. 

## Usage

Install the package in the project of your choice:

```bash
npm install @netlify/netlify-marketing-tokens --save-dev
```

From there, you may import any of the [`dist`](dist) files into your codebase for reuse as desired.

## Releasing

New versions of the package are automatically published to NPM via the [`release-please` GitHub workflow](.github/workflows/release-please.yml):

- [Conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) are enforced via [`@commitlint/cli`](https://npmjs.com/@commitlint/cli)
- A new release PR is generated for an engineer to review
- When the release PR is merged, `release-please` does the following:
  - Updates [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) with the contents of the commits
  - Bumps the version of the [package](package.json) based on the contents of the commits
  - Tags the commit with the version number
  - Creates a GitHub Release based on the tag
  - Publishes the new version to NPM
